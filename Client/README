compile with make
Then run "java Main"

be sure you have compiled and is running WalkerServer in the background
check ../Server/

I put it in CharacterPool.java line 175, almost impossible to find, Sorry for that.

Generate a jar package with

make TestSpel.jar

will also generate mykeys, specify a passphrase for it.
